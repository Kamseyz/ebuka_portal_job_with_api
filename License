### âœ… Final Checklist Before Pushing/Sharing

- [ ] Remove `.env`, `db.sqlite3`, dummy data, and dev-specific code
- [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Clean up unused files or experimental folders
- [ ] Add `README.md`
- [ ] Ensure your repo name and commit messages look professional

Would you like me to help generate a `.gitignore` that matches all this? Or help you clean your commit history before you push it?
